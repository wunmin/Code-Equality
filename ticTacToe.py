### This part contains all the functions needed to run the game


### This function tells player what number to pick for each spot on the board.
def guideBoard():
    print "Refer to this board for the spot number:"
    print "   |   |"
    print " 0 | 1 | 2"
    print "   |   |"
    print "-----------"
    print "   |   |"
    print " 3 | 4 | 5"
    print "   |   |"
    print "-----------"
    print "   |   |"
    print " 6 | 7 | 8"
    print "   |   |"


### This function willl take in a list of 9 items and display each item. To display the item in the list, we do list[x], where [x] begins with 0, instead of 1.
def drawBoard(game):
    print('   |   |')
    print(' ' + game[0] + ' | ' + game[1] + ' | ' + game[2])
    print('   |   |')
    print('-----------')
    print('   |   |')
    print(' ' + game[3] + ' | ' + game[4] + ' | ' + game[5])
    print('   |   |')
    print('-----------')
    print('   |   |')
    print(' ' + game[6] + ' | ' + game[7] + ' | ' + game[8])
    print('   |   |')


### We keep a total count of plays made, starting with 1. If the total count divided by 2 has a remainder of 1, it means the current player is Player 1.
### If the total count divided by 2 has not remainder, it means the current player is Player 2. 
def playerNumber(playerNo):
    if playerNo % 2 == 0:
        return 2
    else:
        return 1

### First player's letter is "O" while second player's letter is "X" 
def playerLetter(num):
	if playerNumber(num) == 1:
		return "O"
	else:
		return "X"


### Here we check if the spot that the Player picks is clearn, i.e. contains a spacebar " ".
def spotClear(spotPicked):
    return boardList[spotPicked] == " "



### Here we ask the Player to give us an input on which spot on the board they would like to play. While 
def playerMove():
    numbers = range(9)
    spot = validateInput("Pick a spot by keying in a number between 0 to 8.\n")
    spot = int(spot)

    while spot not in numbers or not spotClear(spot):
        spot = validateInput("Pick a spot by keying in a number between 0 to 8.\n")
    return int(spot)



### Here we check if the input is an integer. If it is not an integer, print an error message. 
### Thanks SM for helping fix this!    
def validateInput(inputMsg):
    while True:
        try:
            userInput = int(raw_input(inputMsg))
            return userInput
        except ValueError:
            print "Whoops, that is not a number!"

    
### Here we change the item in the list to the player's letter, which is either "O" or "X"
def markSpot():
	boardList[playerMove()] = playerLetter(playerNum)


### This function checks all the combinations that would enable the player to win the game.
